    <strong>Hi, I’m Tyler Evans — in case the URL didn’t give it away.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m a husband to my amazing wife, a proud father of three wild and wonderful
    boys, and a guy who’s really good at turning caffeine into code. When I’m
    not behind a screen, you’ll find me somewhere outside: camping, hiking,
    riding ATVs, hunting, fishing, gardening, or competing in handgun shooting
    matches.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve been building software professionally for over a decade. I started my
    career as a full-stack developer at a small insurance company using .NET.
    From there, I spent several years contracting with a variety of great
    companies and teams, helping build some truly awesome applications. These
    days, I’m a Staff Engineer at <strong>O.C. Tanner</strong> — an incredible employee
    recognition company that actually <i>practices what it preaches</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I’m a maker at heart. I love building with my hands,
    especially in the woodshop or out in the yard. Lately I’ve been hooked on
    fishing — few things are more peaceful than casting a line into a lake or
    river with no cell service in sight.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m passionate about learning, growing, and pushing myself — whether that’s
    leveling up my engineering skills or chasing tighter groups in competition
    shooting. I love exploring my “own backyard” here in Utah, and I rarely turn
    down a chance to get outside with family or friends.

    Thanks for stopping by — feel free to poke around, check out my projects, or
    drop me a message!
